Good morning everyone! Thank you very much giving me the opportunity to present today

My name is upul cooray, currently i am at tohoku university in Japan

let me start by briefly introducing my background

I practiced clinical dentistry for about four year. For me clinical dentistry became very monotonous. usually, I like to be intellectually inactive. for me clinical practice became more of a mechanical skill with very little thinking. 

So I decided to peruse something different and went to UCL to do a MSc in dental public health. by the time I start UCL I did not have any experience or knowledge in epidemiology, statistic. To be frank zero knowledge about research methods in general.  

So, the UCL's MSC was life changing for me and it changed
my whole perception of healthcare. And I started to realize the importance of social determinants,tacking inequalities, common risk factors and so on. 

At that beginning I did not understand anything in the methods section most of the papers. Therefore, I took all the basic epi and statistics classes very seriously. 

Anyhow, I managed to complete the MSc with a distinction and I was competent with basic methods.

Then, Richard introduced me to Jun I came to Japan to do a PhD. Jun helped me to get a generous scholarship to support my stay in japan. 

I completed my PhD September last year and immediately started as a Assistant professor at the same department.

And Jun gave me unlimited freedom to study.

[read the list]

By any means I am not an expert of any of these methods. I do not have any advance training in statistics. So spoiler alert, I am not going to pretend that I understand all the math behind these methods. So my understanding of these methods is largely intuitive. I think this true for most of the researchers in our area.  I do like to understand these methods more deeply (its a work in progress)

This was my first paper. 

when I first start my PhD Jun told me "he has heard about a method call regression discontinuity but not very familiar with it may be I can use it to evaluate Japanese health insurance co-payment discount policy for older adults. 

This is where my interest on econometric methods and causal inference in general sparked. 

We managed to publish this just after 2 years into my PhD.

I think econometric methods are very good in accounting for unmeasured confounding. But it is bit difficult to find data and proper use cases with epidemiological survey data, Eg: finding appropriate strong IV, Data to simulate a synthetic control

I got bored during the initial COVID lock down period. So I wanted to understand little bit about machine learning and started a toy project to predict tooth loss using survey data and I ended up publishing my results in SSM.

and then I used similar methods to work on a project with a Japanese collegeue to predict the fall risk among older adults. Where I contributed as the co-lead.

::: notes
In my understanding no such thing as a "method for causal inference". I think the causality is coming from framing our research question question and defining a statistical model to estimate that. SO even the simplest casusal model is what would have happen if everyone exposed vs everyone not exposed. 

However, In real data given individual unit has only one of those observed. Which the fundamental problem of causal inference. in the potential outcome framework we convert this problem in to a sort of missing data problem to estimate counterfactual outcomes.

When we have the causal model with relevant counteractions we can simply average over potential outcomes and get the difference to calculate Avereage treatment effeft gieen the positivity and unconfoundededness

Basically here we convert our well defined casal question in to statistical model geven these assumption and estimate them using a appropriate estimator.

Then I want to discuss a little about some limitations of this conventional potentional outcome framework

Here I tried to color the map of singapore. Imagine red an blue as diffent values of some exposure. when calculating ATE we forced people in all these districts to have A=1 and then A=0, but in reality given what we know about these district the probabiity of some exposure value might be zero in some of these areas. 


Second, Wen we calculate ATE we contrast to counterfactual worlds with extream oposits of the exposure. So it is bit qustionable its importance in policy 

And also, number of counterfactuals are equalent to number of categories so when you have a categorical or a coutinuous exposure estimation and interpretation becomes bit messy.

So we have to thing Beyond ATE to minimise these limitaions and to improve the flexibility

so much of eveidence ralated to association between social determinants and oral health. but it is difficult for us to quantifiy how much of a disease burden that can be averted if we intervene on social determinants  

Here Im using poverty income ratio from NHANES as the SES indicator.

- My favorite estimation tool is **doubly-robust TMLE** becasue of its many attractive features in estimationg defined MTPs


2. Semi-parametric 

3. Can handle time-varing exposures/confounders

4. Can handle censoring

1. Can use machine learning algorithms to model exposure and outcome flexibly

:::
:::

- Keep learning to understand causal inference more deeply in order to use their full potential within oral epidemiology.

- Investigate meaningful causal questions related to oral health inequalities using good quality longitudinal data sources.

- Extending my current methods for health policy analysis.

- Expanding the scope of my research activities by understanding methods such as microsimulations 

- Writing good quality papers to improve my research portfolio
